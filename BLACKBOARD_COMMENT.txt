Game Day - Final MongoDB Version

📍 FORM LOCATION:
The form is located on the Games page (https://hadeems.github.io/game-day/games) in the "Post a marquee matchup" section. Users can fill out fields including title, league, date, time, venue, city, price, image URL, and summary. The form includes client-side validation that matches the server-side Joi validation rules.

📍 LIST LOCATION:
The list that pulls data from MongoDB is displayed on the same Games page, below the form. It shows all games in a responsive grid layout with images, and includes Edit and Delete buttons for each game item. The list automatically updates when new games are added, edited, or deleted without requiring a page refresh.

🔧 TECHNICAL STACK:
- Frontend: React (client-side validation, state management)
- Backend: Express.js with MongoDB/Mongoose for persistent data storage
- Validation: Joi on server-side, matching validation on client-side
- Hosting: Render (free tier) for API, GitHub Pages for client
- Database: MongoDB Atlas (free tier) - data persists for the session

✅ FEATURES:
- Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- MongoDB persistence using Mongoose
- Image URL support for game pictures
- Real-time UI updates without page refresh
- Server-side and client-side validation in sync

Note: Images are stored as URLs (imageUrl field) pointing to external sources or relative paths. On Render's free plan, images persist for the session but may reset after server restart, which satisfies the assignment requirements.
